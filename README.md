hashbash-load-testing
=====================
This is a simple repository for the locust script I'll use to generate load on
[hashbash-backend-go](https://github.com/norwoodj/hashbash-backend-go) and
[hashbash-backend-java](https://github.com/norwoodj/hashbash-backend-java).

This is another segment of the evaluation I'm doing on go/java apps, in this case, evaluating
http wep server performance/resource utilization between the two versions of the app.

The results generated by this codebase will eventually be put in the blog I'm writing
comparing java and go... (to be linked here someday)
